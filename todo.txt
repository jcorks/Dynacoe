- Animations.

What we have so far:
ASSIMP as the library of choice for loading them in.


Following ASSIMP's structure, we will be supporting 2 types of animtions:

Vertex-Based (deform) animations
Node-Based (bone) animations


Animations in general
---------------------

- Attached to AspectMesh
- Specifies transforms

Node-Based
----------

Requires a new bone class that specifies weights associated with faces.
Any animation that specifies transforms for a bone (by name) will apply that 
locally chained transform by the weight amount to that face 

- Likely requires some shader work to have viable performance
- Node instances need to be attached to the MeshObjects of Meshes
