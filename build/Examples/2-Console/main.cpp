/*  An example showing how to
    interact with the console

using namespace Dynacoe;


// This entity simply posts messages to the console
class ConsoleExample : public Entity {
  public:
    ConsoleExample() {
        SetName("ConsoleEx");

        // Since we are only going to be working in the console,
        // lets have the Entity switch to the console right away for us.
        // This can be done manually by pressing Shift + TAB at any time.
        // While on the console, Shift+TAB will bring you back to the scene.
        // Note that brining up the console does not stop or pause the scene.
        Console::Show(true);

        // Lets output a simple message: "Greetings"
        Console::Info() << "Greetings";


        // The Info() function informs Dynacoe to print output to the console. 
        // To mark the end of the line, the message must end in a Console::End().
        Console::Info() << " and Salutations!" << Console::End(); // now the line reads: Greetings and Salutations!



        // we can also chain pipe commands indefinitely:
        Console::Info() << "How are you?" << Console::End()
                        << "What is new?" << Console::End();
        // For readability, usually lines of output are given their own line
        // when piping multiple lines under one call.


        // there are other line types to try:
        Console::System()    << "This is system info." << Console::End(); 
        Console::Warning() << "This is a warning. Usually for things "
                           << "that are non-fatal." << Console::End();
        Console::Error()   << "This is an error. Usually for things "
                           << "that aren't recoverable." << Console::End();


        // The console piping command also accepts numbers:
        Console::Info() << "My favorite flavor of pi is " << 3.14 << Console::End();

    }
