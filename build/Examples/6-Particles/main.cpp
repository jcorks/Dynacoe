//
// Particle effects require a few things:
// 1) The particle you are going to display. This usually is done through loading a particle file as an asset.
// 2) A ParticleEmitter. ParticleEmitters are the managers for particles

// This example wraps both the emitter and the function of emitting.
class ParticlesExample : public Entity {
  public:
    // Once we load the particle, this will hold the reference to it.
    AssetID particle;

    // The emitter for the particles
    ParticleEmitter2D * particleEmitter;

        // test.part in this directory holds the specification for the particle.
        // Try editing it to see what different effects you can achieve
        particle        = Assets::Load("part", "test.part");

        // When texture filtering is enabled, the pixels of the image of the particle are 
        // blended together. When it's disabled, it tends to give a grainy look, but 
        // will also run faster on some machines. The default when emitting is to use 
        // filtering.

        // In this context, "translucency" is equivalent to additive blending, where transparent colors
        // are added together. The event is layered, transparent images appear lighter in color to more 
        // are drawn in one place. The default when emitting is to draw translucently.
