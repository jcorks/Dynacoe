/** \brief A piecewise function manager that changes inputs
 *  over time.
 *
 *  There are some instances where it is useful to model
 *  the transformation of a value in a complex manner. The Mutator component
 *  provides functionality for simple and complex easing. You can string easing functions
 *  together to achieve more complex behavior in one instance of a Mutator through
 *  the mutation interface.
 *  All times are delt with in seconds and
 *  the Mutator always begins at time 0.
 * Known events:
 * "on-finish" - Called when the end of a mutation cycle is detected. Stopping the mutation will also trigger this event.
