    /* Channels */
    /**
      * \name Channels
      * All audio plays through a number of Channels.
      * Think of a channel as a set of independent audio systems:
      * each channel can have its own set of effects applied to it, can
      * have a specific volume applied, or panning applied. A common set up
      * would be to have a separate channel for Sound Effects,
      * a separate channel for "Background Music", and perhaps another for "Voice Audio".
      *
      * AudioEffects are functors that process and modify raw
      * audio data. AudioEffects are ran on each sample that is played on
      * its owning channel. AudioEffects are ran on samples before it is
      * passed to the mixer for processing.
      *
      * In the case that effect processing is desired for all samples,
      * It is possible to add / remove effects to / from the mixer directly via
      * the *MasterEffect* functions.
