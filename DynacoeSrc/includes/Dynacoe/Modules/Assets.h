/// \brief
/// Handles loading media.
///
/// When working with a multimedia project, you often will need to load in 
/// different kinds of media with varying filetypes and sources. Assets allows 
/// you to work with a common framework for all these types. In specifying the filename 
/// and kind of media, Dynacoe will find the media, load it, and let you start working 
/// with it right away. 
///
/// Any Dynacoe build could have additional supported media types as well. The supported 
/// media types may always be queried using the SupportedLoadExtensions() function.
///
/// As well as loading, Dynacoe also supports exporting for some types. SupportedWriteExtensions()
/// may be used for that purpose.
///
