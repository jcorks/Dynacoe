 *\brief Binary file reading utility.

 * InputBuffer, as the name implies, handles input data. Once instantiated
 * with a target, the InputBuffer can then easily read and process binary data.
 * InputBuffers are the most effective for unpacking data, especially data
 * that is packed in accordance to OutputBuffer routines, as all
 * OutputBuffer writing functions mirror the reading functions of InputBuffer.
 * In the event that one wishes to processes text, the InputBuffer features
 * a handy token grabber as well as the ability to process embedded C-Style
 * strings, making them a viable alternative to other input streams.
