/**
 * \brief Class that extends the functionality of an Entity, but as a removable
 * and addable object.
 *
 * To work, all Component s have hosts; when a host updates, all components do as well.
 * Like Entities, Components can have a Draw and a Step function with an overloadable
 * OnStep / OnDraw. In addition, all Component's also have event handling capabilities.
 * Setable with strings, it is possible to maintain and assign functions to run on 
 * certain events and even define your own events for custom Components.
 * 
 * Using Events
 * ------------
 *
 * When making your own Components, you will typically also want to include 
 * your own custom events. InstallEvent() is the protected function that adds 
 * a new recognized event with the given name. Once installed, EmitEvent() should be called 
 * at the appropriate time user functions should be run.
 * 
 * Any component is aware of at least 2 events: on-attach, called when a 
 * component is bound to its host. and on-detach, right before the removal sequence is started 
 * for a host.
 *
